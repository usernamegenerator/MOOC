In the following examples, assume all graphs are undirected. That is, an edge from A to B is the same as an edge from B to A and counts as exactly one edge.

A clique is an unweighted graph where each node connects to all other nodes. We denote the clique with  nodes as KN. Answer the following questions in terms of .

How many edges are in KN?


  unanswered  n * (n - 1)/2
 
Explanation:

Answer: 
In a directed graph, each node would connect to all other nodes, yielding  edges. In our undirected graph, an edge from A to B and from B to A are the same edge, so there are, in fact, half as many.

Alternatively - if you are familiar with the binomial coefficient - see that for each edge, you must choose two nodes to connect. Thus there are
edges.

Consider the new version of DFS. This traverses paths until all non-circular paths from the source to the destination have been found, and returns the shortest one.

Let A be the source node, and B be the destination in KN. How many paths of length 2 exist from A to B?


  unanswered  n - 2
 
Explanation:

Answer: 
We have a source A and a destination B. Paths of length 2 contain exactly three three nodes. We must select one more node to place in the middle of our path. As we cannot select the A or B, we are left with N - 2 choices to construct a path.

How many paths of length 3 exist from A to B?


  unanswered  (n - 2) * (n - 3)
 
Explanation:

Answer: 
Use the same reasoning as used for the previous problem. After knowing our source and destination, we must travel through 2 additional nodes without touching any node twice. For the first node, we have  choices, and for the second, we have  choices.

Note that this is equivalent to 
Continuing the logic used above, calculate the number of paths of length  from A to B, where , and write this number as a ratio of factorials.

Answer: 
Use the same reasoning as used for the previous problem. After knowing our source and destination, we must travel through 2 additional nodes without touching any node twice. For the first node, we have  choices, and for the second, we have choices.

Note that this is equivalent to 

  unanswered  fact(n - 2)/fact(n - m - 1)
 
Explanation:

Answer: 
Following the previous problems, it is clear that in choosing our first node between A and B, we have  choices. Similarly, in choosing the second, we have  choices.

In fact, in choosing the jth node, we have  choices. Taking the product from j = 1 to m - 1 (since m - 1 nodes exist between A and B in a path of length m), we get 
Using the fact that for any n, , where  is some constant, determine the asymptotic bound on the number of paths explored by DFS. For simplicity, write  as just n,  as n^2, etc.
