Exercise 3
3 points possible (graded)
The following image shows the average low and average high temperature in from the data in julytemps.txt.

vertical bar 1 with top at 95 and bottom at 70 and midpoint at 82 and vertical bar 2 with top at 75 and bottom at 59 and midpoint at 65
The errorbars represent the 95% confidence interval. The 95% confidence interval for the average high is 83.5 +/- 12.9 and the 95% confidence interval for the average low is 67.2 +/- 7.3. Are these two means statistically significant at the 95% confidence interval?


Yes
No correct
unanswered
Explanation

The confidence intervals overlap, so no.

Are these two means statistically significant at the 99.7% confidence interval?

Yes
No correct
unanswered
Explanation

From the first question, you can tell that the standard deviation is about 6.5 (for high temp) and 3.6 (for low temp). The 99.7% confidence interval says that 99.7% of the data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean. Calculating mean+/-3*sigma for the high and low temps gives an overlap in the error bars.

Are these two means statistically significant at the 68% confidence interval?

Yes correct
No
unanswered
Explanation

From the first question, you can tell that the standard deviation is about 6.5 (for high temp) and 3.6 (for low temp). The 68% confidence interval says that 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean. Calculating mean+/-sigma for the high and low temps does not give an overlap in the error bars.
