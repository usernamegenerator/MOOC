Exercise 1
3 points possible (graded)
1. Would placing the drunk's starting location not at the origin change the distances returned?


Yes
No correct
unanswered
Explanation:

No, walk uses the starting location of where the drunk is at the start, not the actual origin.

If so, what line would you modify to compensate? Enter the line number (eg 17). If not, just type None.

1. def simWalks(numSteps, numTrials, dClass):
2.     homer = UsualDrunk()
3.     notOrigin = Location(1, 0)
4.     distances = []
5.     for t in range(numTrials):
6.         f = Field()
7.         f.addDrunk(homer, notOrigin)
8.         distances.append(round(walk(f, homer, numSteps), 1))
9.     return distances

None
  unanswered  None
2. If you were going to use random.seed in a real-life simulation instead of just when you are debugging a simulation, would you want to seed it with 0?


Yes
No correct
unanswered
Explanation:

No; by using random.seed, you create a deterministic simulation rather than a stochastic simulation. You should never use random.seed in a real-life situation, regardless of the seed value!
