Exercise 4
3 points possible (graded)
The coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the mean. Loosely, it's a measure of how variable the population is in relation to the mean.

Figure 1 shows the skyline of Pythonland, and Figure 2 shows the skyline of Montyland.

histogram with 4 bars, heights h1, h2, h3, h4 histogram with 4 bars, heights relative to previous graph, but are smaller
Considering the heights of buildings in Pythonland and Montyland, which has a larger coefficient of variation?


Pythonland
Montyland correct
unanswered
Explanation:

Both have the same standard deviation (the heights are just shifted, which means the means are different, but the standard deviation is the same).

Montyland's buildings are short, but Pythonland's buildings are tall. So the coefficient of variation for Pythonland and Montyland have the same numerator, but a large denominator for Pythonland, and a small one for Montyland. That makes Montyland's coefficient of variation larger.

Which of the following populations has the highest coefficient of variation?


[1, 2, 3] correct
[11, 12, 13]
[0.1, 0.1, 0.1]
unanswered
Explanation:

Both A and B have the same standard deviation, but B has a larger mean. So, A has a higher coefficient of variation. Despite having the smallest mean, C has a standard deviation of 0, and so its coefficient of variation is 0 as well.

Compute the coefficient of variation of [10, 4, 12, 15, 20, 5] to 3 decimal places.
