Exercise 6
4 points possible (graded)
Samples were taken from a distribution, and the histogram of those samples is shown here:
 bell curve centered around 2, 0
Which of the following distributions were the samples taken from?


Uniform Distribution
Exponential Distribution
Normal Distribution correct
unanswered
Explanation:

This is a normal (aka Gaussian) distribution.

Which of the following histograms best matches samples taken from a uniform distribution between 0 and 2?
 bell curve centered around 1, 0 and max height at 300
Figure 1

 equal height bars starting from 0 to 2 and each approx 100 height
Figure 2

 equal height bars starting from 0 to 1 and each approx 200 height
Figure 3

 exponentially decreasing bars starting from 0 with the tail at 2

Mary's Clothes Shoppe is a moderatly busy store. Which of the following histograms best matches observations of how much time (in minutes) there is between customer arrivals? That is, which histogram helps best predict how much time until the next customer comes into the Clothes Shoppe.
For each histogram, 1000 observations were made. The x-axis is measured in minutes, and the height of each bar at minute m corresponds to how many times there was an m minute wait until the next customer arrived.

 exponentially decreasing bars starting from 0 with the tail at 20 max height 450
Figure 1

 bell curve centered around 10, tails at 0 and 20, max height at 350
Figure 2

 equal height bars starting from 0 to 20 and each approx 100 height

Explanation:

The best match is Figure 1. It is common for a busy store to have frequent customers and it is most common that the next customer arrives shortly after the previous customer. It is rare - but not impossible - for there to be a 15+ minute gap between one customer and the next; but typically we see 1-5 minute gaps.

Generally, inter-arrival time problems are modeled well by exponential distributions.
