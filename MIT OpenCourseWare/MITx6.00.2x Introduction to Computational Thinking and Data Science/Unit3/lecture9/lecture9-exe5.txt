Exercise 5
3 points possible (graded)
You are given two data files. Each file contains 1800 data points measuring the heart rate (in beats per minute, every 0.5 seconds) of a subject prforming comparable activities for the duration of 15 minutes: hr1.txt and hr2.txt. The data is plotted in the figures below. (note that the data is taken from the MIT-BIH Database)

graph with xaxis label (time sec*2) and yaxis label (heart rate bpm) and noisy jagged graph around y=90 and from x=0 to x=1750graph with xaxis label (time sec*2) and yaxis label (heart rate bpm) and graph with frequency of 100 around y=90 and from x=0 to x=1750
Using a sample size of 250, decide whether the following methods of drawing samples will yield samples where the examples are independent of each other.

Using random.sample

Examples are independent in hr1 sample. correct
Examples are independent in hr2 sample. correct
unanswered
Getting a random number between 1 and 1800, 250 times.

Examples are independent in hr1 sample.
Examples are independent in hr2 sample.
Neither h1 nor h2 give independent examples. correct
unanswered
This method might get repeat values because it it performing selection with replacement

Starting at the first example and going until the 500th example.

Examples are independent in hr1 sample.
Examples are independent in hr2 sample.
Neither h1 nor h2 give independent examples. correct
unanswered
Looking at the data in h1, you can see that the samples from 0 to 250 are higher than the examples between 250 and 500. In the hr2 data, the examples occur with a frequency of 125, so taking the first 250 and then the next 250 will give almost the same average but the standard deviation will be different.
